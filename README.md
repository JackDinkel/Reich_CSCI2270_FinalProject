# Reich_CSCI2270_FinalProject

#Project Summary:

This project is intended to assess the limits of basic hash functions.  It will have a built in sets of data to test as keys, as well as built in hash functions to test.  These are not intended to be rigorous cryptographic hash functions, but simply introductory functions to illustrate chance of collisions and load factor.  The program will also offer the user the opportunity to load their own data sets to test.  I would also like to be able to have the user load additional functions to test, but that might be something to be added in phase 3.  A simple menu similar to that of the past several assignments will allow the user to select which  utiliity to run, and select which function and data set to test.  Output will be given as number of collisions, and the corresponding load factor.  There may also be options to try different functions with varying table sizes.  There could also be an option to calculate the recommended hash table size.  Finally, I would also like to include a slightly more advanced algorithm, such as sha1, which is readily accessible in order to see the differences.
